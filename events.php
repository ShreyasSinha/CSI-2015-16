                                    <p>Meet Us and Join Us - The most interactive, fun loving and advanced techno-management society of DTU. Face-to-face orientation to know who we are and what we do and our vision. Its 1PM, and your teacher is teaching you AP-AC and suddenly, this one senior peeps through the class door and asks, “Sir can I speak to the class for 2 min! Sir, it won’t take long, just 2 min?” Experienced that already? Well, those are your second years, who will come to your class introducing their respective societies to you. Telling you how they are better, how they carry out the most exclusive range of events and much more about their societies. We would be doing (if haven’t done already) the same. But more than the class to class society-introduction, we urge you to attend the orientation. </p>
                                    <p>CSI orientation is a 1-1.5 hour event, held after college hours for everyone interested in joining our society. Aimed at providing you all the essential details about our society, this event, organised by the second years, is a must-attend event. We provide you a brief account of everything that we do throughout the year. And don’t worry; it is not one of those conventional boring orientations that you think it’d be. Being your seniors, we highly recommend you to attend the orientation. Not just CSI orientation, but the orientation of any society that you wish to join. Hope to see you there then .</p>

                                    <p>“INTEREST DEVELOPMENT GROUPS(IDGs)" is a platform to enhance your skills a learn a lot more.Special classes on coding, Android development, web development, etc. are organised by the third and fourth year seniors. The classes are held on weekly basis .For around 90% of us when we come to college we actually are not aware of our interests and the area we actually wants to work in. Infact  we are also not aware of the courses and platforms that exist on which we can make our career. So this is the place where you can actually focus and work on what you are really interesred in .When students come in first year we organise a different IDGs thought a week which is “open for all students” so that they can attend and know about courses and can actually decide what they are interested in .</p>
                                    <p>These IDGs really help as you get a brief introduction about the topics. After that the IDGs are conducted on weekly basis for CSI members only.The seniors may involve you in their projects if the find it you worth it.</p>

                                    <p> "Hasta la Vista" is the Fuchcha Week organised, co-ordinated and volunteered completely by first year members of the Computer Society of India-DTU Chapter. It's the chance to participate in some simple mind games and grab prizes, fuchchas! So come on, and admist enjoyment, have the best you can before the end-sems begin.....before the year ends! It may be the first experience for you to organise and event too.This is the one fest that, you, first years will especially like. Because the complete responsibility for this fest is on the first years. You conceive the events, you plan them, you organise them and you conduct them. The complete onus is on you. And the events here are absolutely non-technical. 
</p>
                                    <p> Held around the last week of April, hasta la vista aka fuchcha week, had events like game-o-droid (students had to compete in android games like fruit ninja, 2048 etc), pixelf (best selfie out of the many entries we received was chosen as the winner), know your campus (quiz on the various locations in campus) was held, among others! 
                            So brace yourself to organise this entire week of creativity and enthusiasm.</p>

                                    <p>"Ethical Hacking & Cyber Forensics" workshop is organised by CSI-DTU. It is a 2 day workshop (total of 16 hours) meant for all those interested in learning hacking and cyber security.We collaborate with different security consulting firms and conduct the workshop. You must have encountered the word “hacking” many times and you must have wandered what it actually is as some people treat it “ILLEGAL” while some treat it “LEGAL”  Hacking is not always about the illegal things it's all about how to secure your system. In the two days workshop Google Hacking, Email Hacking, Dos Attacks, Torjens, SQL Injection, Windows Hacking, Mobile Hacking etc. topics are covered. This workshop aims to give Technocrats a basic knowledge of hacking and how to protect your system against hazardous effects.  </p>
                                    <p> Firstly, the workshop gives a student an insight of the Ethical Hacking i.e compromise of email hacking DOS attacks SQL Injection etc. if you have the interest to be the part of one them this surely is the place to be at to get the firsthand experience of working on high end projects .Students get to work with the Working Professionals in Digital Security Field and get to match up their Knowledge and Experience.Also the workshop doesn't end up then and there. They can contact the concerned faculties throughout their graduation or thereafter also if they need any guidance regarding industrial Projects and Placements.They provide you future help and guidance for participating in competitions and these competitions are what makes you skillfull and enhance your practical knowledge towards which they are gonna make your first step.</p>

                                    <p>"Avantgarde" is a techinical week organised just after our tiring mid sems exams.It is a 3-4 days event with  many competitions. This event is the first event, where you as first years would be part of the event, both as organisers as well as participants. From coding events, to LAN gaming to quizzing to debating, you name it and we have it. Aimed at making you compete with others who share the same passion, this fest is a great way to start building your CVs. This 3-4 day event not only includes various competitions, but also includes various workshops. Last year, we had workshops on augmented reality, game theory and machine learning, each of which is an important as well as interesting field of study. The first years get a chance to interact and work with seniors and them well.All that matters is the confidence and leadership qualities ,which can be developed by organising, participating or being a part of such events in any way possible. And, well, who doesn’t like prizes and certificates!  </p>
                                    <p>So gear yourself for this one week of technical as well as non-technical extravaganza!</p>
